# React Fiber

## new concepts

### reconciliation

react使用的计算树的不同的算法

### reconciliation versus rendering

不管是DOM还是安卓和ios，都有自己的渲染机制，但是可以共享reconciliation带来的增量渲染信息

### scheduling

调度：决定何时干什么工作

通常在更新的时候运行，计算所有需要渲染的计算

React's [Design Principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html#scheduling) document is so good on this subject that I'll just quote it here:

> In its current implementation React walks the tree recursively and calls render functions of the whole updated tree during a single tick. However in the future it might start delaying some updates to avoid dropping frames.
>
> This is a common theme in React design. Some popular libraries implement the "push" approach where computations are performed when the new data is available. React, however, sticks to the "pull" approach where computations can be delayed until necessary.
>
> React is not a generic data processing library. It is a library for building user interfaces. We think that it is uniquely positioned in an app to know which computations are relevant right now and which are not.
>
> If something is offscreen, we can delay any logic related to it. If data is arriving faster than the frame rate, we can coalesce and batch updates. We can prioritize work coming from user interactions (such as an animation caused by a button click) over less important background work (such as rendering new content just loaded from the network) to avoid dropping frames.

关键点在于：

- 对于用户界面来说立刻应用更新是不必要的，事实上，这是很浪费的，会导致掉帧和降低用户体验
- 不同的更新有不同的优先级--一个动画更新需要比比说如说远程数据更新更快
- A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you
